        <h2>Grindcore/Hardcore cross over based out of Maidstone, England</h2>
        <p>SEHC Represent. Based out of Maidstone, Kent, England. Convulsion cross elements of Hardcore and Grindcore to create an onslaught of noise blended in with breakdowns to create a truly ferocious sound. Formed from 4 school friends, Jamie alongside Patrick Ransom, Euan Wood and Jack Packard, the band has gone onto release 2 EPs. "Everything Will Be Okay" was released in 2022 with the follow up EP "You Falter. You Fail. You Fall." being release late 2023. The band has represented South East Hardcore (SEHC) across the UK in the past 2 years, playing with heavyweights such as The Chisel, SeeYouSpaceCowboy... and Bandit. Whilst I am no longer in the band as a full time member due to the amount of travel between Ireland and Dublin, I still contribute to writing and have am still writing with them currently. A lot of the writing is now done remotely with Euan, where we work on riffs and ideas together that the band then practices and performs. We are hoping to bring them to Ireland soon for an upcoming LaVein tour which will be their first international shows.</p>
